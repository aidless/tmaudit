# PyPI Upload Prep — v0.4.1

> **Status**: ⏳ in progress
> **Target release**: v0.4.1 (≤ 2026-08-10 per §15.5)
> **Date prepared**: 2026-07-10

## 0. Name-availability check (DONE)

PyPI name check on 2026-07-10:

| Name | Status |
|---|---|
| `tmaudit` | **FREE** (404 from PyPI JSON + simple index) |
| `tmaudit-cli` | FREE |
| `tmaudit-dryrun` | FREE |
| `tmaudit-plugin` | FREE |
| 25 candidates total | ALL FREE |

No name collision. We can ship under the canonical
name `tmaudit`.

See `F:\temp\check_pypi_names.py` for the full check
script (4 sections: candidate sweep, PEP 503
normalization, simple index, search).

## 1. Required changes to `pyproject.toml`

The current `pyproject.toml` is minimal and pre-release.
It needs to grow for PyPI publication. Here's the diff
we need to apply:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "tmaudit"                                          # was: "tmaudit"
version = "0.4.1"                                        # was: "0.1.0"
description = "Config-driven TMLR paper audit + LaTeX compile pipeline"
readme = "README.md"                                      # NEW
requires-python = ">=3.9"
license = {text = "MIT"}                                  # NEW
authors = [
    {name = "Liu Zewen", email = "aidless@example.com"},
]
keywords = ["tmaudit", "tmlr", "audit", "latex", "compile", "plugins"]
classifiers = [                                            # NEW
    "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
    "Intended Audience :: Science/Research",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12",
    "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering",
    "Topic :: Software Development :: Quality Assurance",
]

[project.urls]                                            # NEW
Homepage = "https://github.com/aidless/tmaudit"
Issues = "https://github.com/aidless/tmaudit/issues"
Source = "https://github.com/aidless/tmaudit"
Changelog = "https://github.com/aidless/tmaudit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md"

dependencies = []  # tmaudit has zero runtime deps in v0.4.x

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest>=7", "mypy>=1.0", "build>=0.10", "twine>=4"]

[project.scripts]
tmaudit = "tmaudit.cli:main"

[tool.setuptools]
package-dir = {"" = "src"}

[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]
include = ["tmaudit*"]

[tool.setuptools.package-data]
tmaudit = [
    "templates/*.py",
    "templates/*.tex",
    "configs/*.py",
]
```

The key changes are:
- `name = "tmaudit"` (already was; the name is good)
- `version = "0.4.1"` (was 0.1.0; bump for v0.4.1)
- `readme = "README.md"` (NEW; PyPI renders this)
- `license = {text = "MIT"}` (NEW; needs LICENSE file)
- `authors` populated
- `classifiers` (NEW; helps PyPI categorise)
- `project.urls` (NEW; PyPI sidebar links)
- `dev` extras: add `build`, `twine` for PyPI upload

## 2. Required new files

### 2.2 `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml` (NEW)

A GitHub Actions workflow that uses **trusted publishing**
(no API tokens stored in secrets). Triggered by a
release on GitHub. Publishes to PyPI on tag push.

```yaml
name: Publish Python Package

on:
  release:
    types: [published]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  pypi-publish:
    name: Publish to PyPI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: pypi
    permissions:
      id-token: write   # for trusted publishing (OIDC)
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"
      - name: Install build tooling
        run: python -m pip install --upgrade build
      - name: Build sdist and wheel
        run: python -m build
      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        # No `password:` field — uses OIDC trusted publishing.
```

PyPI trusted publishing is set up at:
<https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/>

(Project: `aidless/tmaudit`, Owner: `aidless`, Workflow:
`publish-pypi.yml`, Environment: `pypi`.)

## 3. Manual dry-run (recommended)

Before tagging v0.4.1, do a **local dry-run**:

```bash
# Build the distribution
cd F:\Research\TEMPLATE
python -m pip install --upgrade build
python -m build

# Inspect the output
ls -la dist/
# Should contain:
#   tmaudit-0.4.1-py3-none-any.whl
#   tmaudit-0.4.1.tar.gz

# Verify metadata
python -m zipfile -e dist/tmaudit-0.4.1-py3-none-any.whl /tmp/whl-check/
cat /tmp/whl-check/tmaudit-0.4.1.dist-info/METADATA
```

Verify that:
- `Name: tmaudit`
- `Version: 0.4.1`
- `Requires-Python: >=3.9`
- `License: MIT` (or whatever)
- `Provides-Extra: dev`

```bash
# Optional: TestPyPI dry-run
python -m pip install --upgrade twine
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
# Installs from:
#   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ tmaudit==0.4.1
```

If TestPyPI accepts the upload, the actual PyPI upload
should be a no-op. The only thing that can go wrong at
real PyPI is name collision (we've checked) or
classification (we've chosen well-formed ones).

## 4. Tag and release

```bash
cd F:\Research\TEMPLATE
git tag -a v0.4.1 -m "v0.4.1 - first PyPI release (bug fixes, docs, no API change)"
git push origin v0.4.1
# GitHub Action triggers automatically (after first manual
# approval of the trusted-publisher on PyPI).
```

## 5. Post-release verification

```bash
# In a fresh venv:
python -m venv /tmp/tmaudit-test
source /tmp/tmaudit-test/bin/activate
pip install tmaudit==0.4.1
tmaudit list            # should show 5 papers
tmaudit plugins list    # should show 3 example plugins (if tmaudit-example-plugin also uploaded)
python -c "import tmaudit; print(tmaudit.__version__)"  # should print 0.4.1
tmaudit --version
```

If all 4 checks pass, v0.4.1 is live on PyPI and the
public release cycle is unblocked.

## 6. Risks

- **PyPI upload can fail for non-name reasons**:
  network errors, missing classifiers, unsupported
  python version, malformed description. These show up
  in `twine upload` output and are fixable.
- **Trusted-publishing approval**: the first
  `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` run will fail with
  "no trusted publisher configured" until you add the
  publisher at <https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/>.
  This is a 5-minute manual setup.
- **License debate**: I chose MIT. If the maintainer
  prefers Apache 2.0, the LICENSE file + `license =`
  field need to change. Apache 2.0 has a patent grant;
  MIT is simpler. We can flip in v0.4.2 if there's
  pushback.

## 7. What's NOT in v0.4.1

- **No new audit category** (that's v0.5.0+).
- **No new feature** (that's v0.5.0+).
- **No plugin API change** (that would be v0.5.0).
- **No C1..C10 → Finding migration** (that's v0.6.0).

v0.4.1 is purely: **ship v0.4.0 to PyPI + fix any
community-reported bugs + add `pyproject.toml` fields
PyPI requires**.

## 8. Effort estimate

| Task | Effort |
|---|---|
| Edit `pyproject.toml` (10 fields) | 5 min |
| Add `LICENSE` (MIT) | 5 min |
| Add `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml` | 10 min |
| Configure PyPI trusted publisher (web UI) | 5 min |
| Build + twine dry-run | 5 min |
| Tag v0.4.1 + push | 1 min |
| Post-release verification | 5 min |
| **Total** | **~35 min** |

Most of the work is the trusted-publisher setup (one
click on PyPI's web UI). The code changes are
mechanical.

---

**Maintainer action**: review the 10 `pyproject.toml`
field changes, choose license (MIT vs Apache 2.0), and
run through the 8 steps above. Then update CHANGELOG +
RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.1.md with the "now on PyPI" callout.

**Status of this doc**: ⏳ 30% done (sections 0-2 written;
sections 3-8 are placeholders for the maintainer to fill
in during the actual upload).
