"""tmaudit — config-driven TMLR paper audit + LaTeX compile pipeline.

This package bundles:
  * The generic 10-category audit template (C1..C10)
  * The generic 4-pass LaTeX compile script
  * The generic abstract-Unicode -> LaTeX-math fixer
  * Per-paper PAPER_CONFIGS for all five TMLR papers
  * A plugin API (added in v0.4.0) for user-written audit checks
  * External paper configs (added in v0.6.0): `verify --target FILE`
    runs the same audit path on a paper that is not in PAPER_CONFIGS
  * A read-only `Target` view (added in v0.6.0) over the audited object,
    so a plugin can ask for sections and citations instead of re-parsing
    LaTeX

and exposes a single CLI:

    tmaudit --list
    tmaudit verify --paper N [--paper-dir PATH]
    tmaudit verify --paper N
    tmaudit verify --paper-dir PATH        # generic checks, empty config
    tmaudit verify --target paper.toml     # external config, rules included
    tmaudit admission --gain 7.3 --tasks 89
    tmaudit compile --paper N
    tmaudit fix-unicode --paper N
    tmaudit audit-all
    tmaudit plugins list

The package can be installed with `pip install tmaudit/` (or
`pip install -e .` for editable mode) and shipped as a single
executable .pyz file with `python -m zipapp`.
