## Pre-merge checklist

<!--
Every box MUST be checked before the PR is merged.
The CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and the pre-commit hook
(`hooks/pre-commit`) check many of these automatically, but
the human author must still verify the rest.
-->

### Automated checks (CI runs these)

- [ ] `pytest` passes locally (46 tests, ~0.4s)
- [ ] `python _check_all_regressions.py` reports 6/6 caught
- [ ] `python _build_pyz.py` produces a working `tmaudit.pyz`
- [ ] `python tmaudit.pyz list` lists the correct papers
- [ ] `python _check_yaml.py` reports `ci.yml` is valid
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI is green on this branch
- [ ] Pre-commit hook passed (or `--no-verify` was justified in PR description)

### Manual checks (the author must verify)

- [ ] I have read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and followed its guidance
- [ ] If this PR adds a new audit category, a sample paper (Paper 1 or 5) still passes
- [ ] If this PR changes `verify_TEMPLATE.py`, the audit output is identical on a known paper
- [ ] If this PR changes `paper_configs.py`, the per-paper audit still produces 0 findings
- [ ] If this PR adds a regression test for a bug, I have verified the test **fails** when the bug is injected (using `_check_all_regressions.py`)
- [ ] If this PR fixes a bug, the new test is referenced from `engineering_notes_verify_template.md`
- [ ] If this PR adds a paper (Paper 6+), the `TestEndToEndAudit` test for it is added
- [ ] If this PR changes public API, the CLI still works (`tmaudit --help`, `tmaudit list`, `tmaudit verify --paper N`)
- [ ] If this PR changes the audit logic, I have manually re-run the audit on Paper 1 and confirmed 0 findings
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry for this change under the next version

### Documentation

- [ ] `README.md` is updated (if user-facing behavior changes)
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` is updated (if dev workflow changes)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` is updated
- [ ] `engineering_notes_verify_template.md` is updated (if a bug is fixed or a new bug is discovered)

## Test plan

<!--
How did you verify the change works? Paste command output, test
logs, audit results, or screenshots.

GOOD: "Added test_forge.py::TestBug6X. Ran pytest: 47 passed
       in 0.35s. The new test fails when the strict regex
       is substituted back into the template (verified via
       _check_all_regressions.py)."
GOOD: "Ran tmaudit verify --paper 1 -> 0 finding(s).
       Before this PR: 1 finding. After: 0 findings."
BAD:  "I tested it and it works."
-->

```
# Paste command output here
```

## Screenshots / output

<!--
Optional. If the change is user-visible (CLI, audit report,
PDF), paste a screenshot or the output of `tmaudit verify
--paper N`. If the change is purely internal, delete this
section.

## Breaking changes

<!--
If you checked "Breaking change" above, describe:
  - What breaks?
  - Who is affected?
  - What is the migration path?

If not a breaking change, write "None" and delete this section.

## Reviewer notes

<!--
Anything specific you want the reviewer to focus on. Examples:
  - "I'm unsure about the regex in check_c5; please verify it
    against the test cases in §5 of engineering_notes."
  - "I considered X but went with Y because Z. Happy to
    discuss if you disagree."
  - "This is the first time I've touched the templates; please
    be extra careful about the string-literal state machine."
