# tmaudit

**Catch the reporting defects reviewers catch — before you submit.**

`tmaudit` audits the LaTeX source of a machine-learning paper for the things
that get flagged in review but are cheap to fix: a missing code/data statement,
unreported seeds and hyperparameters, a figure whose label is never referenced,
ceremonial citations, and significance claims with no power analysis. No API
key, no network, and no required dependencies.

```

Excerpt of real output from a deliberately flawed sample manuscript
([`examples/sample-paper/`](examples/sample-paper/)):

```text
Findings by category:
  C9  [MEDIUM]  1 finding(s)
  C10  [LOW]    5 finding(s)

[MEDIUM] C9  (global)
    MED: figure fig:unused is defined but never referenced in the body text
    (no \ref{fig:unused} or \autoref{fig:unused}). Reviewer §5 #9.

[LOW] C10  (global)
    HIGH: paper has no code/data availability statement (no
    \section{...Availability...}, no GitHub/GitLab/Zenodo URL, and no
    "code is available" phrase). Reviewer §5 #10.
```

## What it checks

| Category | What it catches |
|---|---|
| **C4** | citations that do not resolve to a `.bib`/`.bbl` entry |
| **C5** | sample size and effect-size omissions |
| **C7** | ceremonial citations (cited, never engaged with) |
| **C8** | significance claims without a reported effect size or power analysis |
| **C9** | figures without a caption below the graphic; `fig:` labels never referenced |
| **C10** | no availability statement; missing seeds, hyperparameters, hardware, library versions |
| **C1–C3, C6** | per-paper rulepack for five specific manuscripts: symbol definition, Bonferroni consistency, formalization, hype vocabulary |

C4–C10 run on any LaTeX manuscript. C1–C3 and C6 are configuration-driven and
report **not applicable** on a paper the rulepack was not written for — that is
stated in the output, not silently reported as a pass.

## Scope, stated plainly

This is not a reviewer and does not judge novelty. It checks reporting
completeness against a fixed rulepack, and it tells you when a category did not
run. For checks the generic categories do not cover, write a plugin
([`docs/PLUGINS.md`](docs/PLUGINS.md)) — the contract is a function that
receives the paper root and returns `Finding` objects.

## Install

```bash
pipx install tmaudit                 # or: pip install tmaudit
```

Zero-install single file (Python 3.9+, standard library only):

```bash
python tmaudit.pyz verify --paper-dir path/to/your/paper
```

From source, including the example plugin that the test suite expects:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidless/tmaudit
cd tmaudit
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pip install -e ./tmaudit_example_plugin
python -m pytest -q
```

## Try it on the sample, no paper needed

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidless/tmaudit
cd tmaudit
pipx install tmaudit          # or: pip install -e .
tmaudit verify --paper-dir examples/sample-paper
```

`verify` forks a `verify_generic.py` script into the target directory and runs
it. That file is the entire audit, in the open: read it, edit the thresholds, or
delete it after the run. It is generated, not a hidden binary.

## Extend it: your own checks

A plugin is a package exposing a function decorated with `@check` under the
`tmaudit.plugins` entry-point group. It receives the paper's root `.tex` and
returns `Finding` objects.

```bash
tmaudit plugins list
tmaudit plugins run my-check --paper-dir /path/to/your/paper
```

The full contract and a three-check example ship in
[`tmaudit_example_plugin/`](tmaudit_example_plugin/) and
[`docs/PLUGINS.md`](docs/PLUGINS.md).

## Self-audit: the audit core on 25 real papers

The rulepack is per-paper by design, so the sharpest question a reader can
ask is: *what does this tool do on a paper its config was not written for?*
We ran all ten categories over **25 real arXiv `cs.CL` LaTeX sources**,
exactly as `main()` runs them.

It found four defects in the tool itself:

- the factory `CHECKS_CONFIG` was one specific paper's config, so a generic
  run fired that paper's checks against any document;
- "clean" could mean "did not run" — a category with no configuration
  reported zero findings, indistinguishable from a pass;
- one missing config key aborted the whole audit with a `KeyError`;
- the BibTeX key pattern fabricated "missing citation" findings for keys
  that were present in `refs.bib`, whenever a key sat on its own line.

**All four are fixed in v0.5.1**, with regression tests; the two smaller
findings (a `SyntaxWarning` on import, and an observation failure filed as a
HIGH finding) are fixed as well. The v0.5.0 findings are kept verbatim as
evidence, and the harness restores the v0.5.0 config so the config-driven
defects replay: [`case-studies/arxiv-corpus/`](case-studies/arxiv-corpus/README.md)
has the coverage matrix, the method, and what the numbers do **not**
establish.

### Auditing a paper the rulepack was not written for

[`case-studies/arxiv-2502.14074/`](case-studies/arxiv-2502.14074/README.md)
runs the two public extension paths — `verify --paper-dir` and two plugin
checks — against one real paper (*Investigating Non-Transitivity in
LLM-as-a-Judge*, arXiv:2502.14074, ICML 2025). It reports two
reporting-standards observations, records three candidate weaknesses that
were checked and **withdrawn**, and surfaced a caption-parsing defect in
the tool (nested braces), fixed in this commit. Every input is pinned by
SHA-256; the results, and what the audit does **not** establish, are in its
README.

## v0.3.0 highlights

**Released: 2026-07-10.** This release adds 3 new audit categories
(C8, C9, C10) and brings the project to **10 categories, 176 unit
tests, 12/12 meta-test bugs caught, 5/5 papers auditable**.

| Category | What it checks | Severity | Always runs? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C1** (v0.1.0) | Symbol inline definition | HIGH | Yes |
| **C2** (v0.1.0) | Bonferroni consistency | HIGH | Yes |
| **C3** (v0.1.0) | Formalization of key concept | MEDIUM | Yes |
| **C4** (v0.1.0) | Self-citation threshold | MEDIUM | Yes |
| **C5** (v0.1.0) | Test-name d | MEDIUM | Yes |
| **C6** (v0.1.1) | Blacklist word frequency | LOW | Yes |
| **C7** (v0.1.2) | Ceremonial citation detection | MEDIUM | Yes |
| **C8** (v0.3.0) | **Statistical power** (d-mismatch, post-hoc power) | HIGH/MED | No (opt-in) |
| **C9** (v0.3.0) | **Figure-caption consistency** (4 sub-checks) | HIGH/MED | Yes (sub-check 3 opt-in) |
| **C10** (v0.3.0) | **Reproducibility** (availability, metadata, consistency) | HIGH/MED/LOW | Yes (sub-check 2 opt-in) |
| **C7-LLM** (v0.2.0) | LLM fallback for C7 borderline cases (opt-in via `TMAUDIT_LLM_*` env) | MEDIUM | No |

**v0.2.0 added** (still shipping): `audit-all --output report.md`
generates a single Markdown report covering all papers; the report
is uploaded as a CI artefact.

**v0.2.0 added** (still shipping): per-paper config for Paper 2,
Paper 3, Paper 4 (was placeholder in v0.1.1). All 5 papers
(P1..P5) are now auditable.

**Per-paper config** for v0.3.0: `c8_claimed_effects` (statistical),
`c9_figure_keywords` (figure-caption), `c10_reproducibility_claims`
(reproducibility). Empty list = opt-out (with graceful degradation
in C9 and C10).

See [`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.0.md`](./RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.0.md) for the
full release notes and [`engineering_notes_verify_template.md`](./engineering_notes_verify_template.md)
§12 (C8+C10) and §13 (C9) for the design rationale.

## CLI reference

```text
tmaudit list                              # show all known paper configs
tmaudit verify --paper N [--dry-run]      # fork verify_pN.py + run audit
tmaudit compile --paper N [--dry-run]     # fork _compile_check.py + 4-pass build
tmaudit fix-unicode --paper N [--dry-run] # fork _fix_abstract_unicode.py
tmaudit audit-all [--start 1] [--end 5]   # verify all papers in a range
```

Every subcommand also accepts `--paper-dir PATH` to override the
default paper directory.

## The standard 3-step protocol for any new paper

```powershell
cd F:\Research\PAPER<N>_CONSOLIDATED

# 1. audit
tmaudit verify --paper N

# 2. fix abstract Unicode (if any finding)
tmaudit fix-unicode --paper N
tmaudit verify --paper N

# 3. compile
tmaudit compile --paper N
```

## Adding a new paper (e.g., Paper 6)

Edit **two** files:

1. `src/tmaudit/configs/paper_configs.py` — add a new entry to
   `PAPER_CONFIGS` (or `VERIFY_CONFIGS` after re-export). The fields
   are documented in the docstring at the top of that file.
2. `src/tmaudit/configs/compile_configs.py` — add a matching entry
   to `COMPILE_CONFIGS`. The fields are documented in the docstring
   there.

Then:

```powershell
python -m pip install --editable . --break-system-packages
python _build_pyz.py
tmaudit list               # confirm Paper 6 shows up
tmaudit verify --paper 6   # fork + run; will report any HIGH-severity
                           # issues caused by your config choices
```

## Verifying the .pyz is portable

```bash
# On the source machine:
python _build_pyz.py
# -> tmaudit.pyz (64 KB)

# Copy tmaudit.pyz to a fresh machine with no Python packages installed
# (only a base Python 3.9+ interpreter):
scp tmaudit.pyz other-host:/tmp/
ssh other-host 'python /tmp/tmaudit.pyz list'
# -> should print the same 5-paper table
```

The `.pyz` has **no external dependencies** (only the Python standard
library). It works on Linux, macOS, and Windows alike.

## Bug history

The **twelve historical bugs** encountered while building this
package are documented in
[`engineering_notes_verify_template.md`](./engineering_notes_verify_template.md).
Each bug has a dedicated regression test in
`tests/test_forge_happy.py`, `tests/test_bug5_unit.py`,
`tests/test_c6_threshold.py`, `tests/test_c7_citation_context.py`,
`tests/test_cache.py`, `tests/test_c10_reproducibility.py`,
`tests/test_c8_statistical_power.py`, and
`tests/test_c9_figure_caption.py`. The meta-test
(`_check_all_regressions.py`) injects each bug in turn, asserts the
regression test catches it, and restores the source. **14/14 bugs
are caught.**

The fix patterns (raw-string regex literals, brace-counting state
machines, non-letter-class regex, second/third-pass audit logic,
sentinel-character sub-string extraction, etc.) are all implemented
in `src/tmaudit/forge.py` and
`src/tmaudit/templates/verify_TEMPLATE.py`.

## Continuous integration

### Workflow

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push and pull request.
It consists of **seven** jobs:

1. **pytest** (matrix: Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 on
   `ubuntu-latest` — every version `requires-python >=3.9` claims)
   — runs the **246-test** suite and uploads JUnit XML artifacts.
2. **meta-test** (Python 3.11) — runs `_check_all_regressions.py`
   to verify that each of the **14 regression tests** actually catches
   its target bug, then runs `_check_pyz_fresh.py` to confirm the
   committed `tmaudit.pyz` still matches `src/tmaudit/`, and finally
   builds the archive and runs it as a smoke test.
3. **validate-community-files** (Python 3.11) — runs
   `_check_github_templates.py` to verify the `.github/`
   directory structure (4 issue templates, PR template, CODEOWNERS,
   dependabot.yml, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SUPPORT, workflows).
4. **audit-all** (Python 3.11) — runs
   `tmaudit audit-all --start 1 --end 5 --output audit-report.md
   --no-cache` and uploads the Markdown report as a CI artefact.
5. **lint** (Python 3.11) — runs `pyflakes` on `src/tmaudit/`
   and `tests/`.
6. **mutation-control** (Python 3.11) — proves the pytest and lint
   gates can actually fail: injects a known mutation, asserts both
   gates go red, then asserts a deliberately neutralised gate (wrapped
   in `|| true`) is rejected as a negative control.
7. **secret-scan** (Python 3.11) — scans the full history with
   `gitleaks`, so a committed credential fails the build.

### Local validation (before pushing)

To run the same checks locally before pushing:

```bash
pip install -e . pytest pyflakes
pip install -e ./tmaudit_example_plugin
pytest
python _check_all_regressions.py
python _check_pyz_fresh.py
python _build_pyz.py
python tmaudit.pyz list
python -m pyflakes src/tmaudit/ tests/
```

`pytest` runs the full suite: **246 passed, 3 skipped** on a machine
without the research tree — the two `@pytest.mark.slow` end-to-end audit
tests require the real `PAPER<N>_CONSOLIDATED` papers and auto-skip when
the directory is absent (point `TMAUDIT_RESEARCH_DIR` at the tree to run
them). **Scope note:** CI runs `pytest -m "not slow"`, which deselects
those two and reports **246 passed, 1 skipped, 2 deselected** — both
lines above are the same 249 collected tests, differing only in the two
deselected slow tests.

### Local CI simulation (`act` / `_act_*`)

The preferred tool for local CI simulation is
[nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

```bash
act -l                    # list jobs
act -j pytest             # run the pytest job
act -j meta-test          # run the meta-test job (after pytest)
act -j lint               # run the lint job
```

`act` requires `act` installed **and** a working Docker daemon.
If either is unavailable (e.g., on a restricted sandbox machine),
this repo ships two **fallback** simulators:

| Script | `act` equivalent | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `_act_dryrun.py` | `act -n` (dry-run) | Parses `ci.yml`, expands the matrix, prints what each step would do. **No commands are executed.** |
| `_act_simulate.py` | `act` (real run) | Same as dryrun, but actually runs the `run:` steps via `subprocess`. Implements stubs for `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-python@v5`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4`. |

```bash
python _act_dryrun.py            # show what would be executed
python _act_dryrun.py --list     # show jobs only
python _act_simulate.py --list   # list jobs (act -l equivalent)
python _act_simulate.py --job pytest    # run pytest job
```

### CI simulation results

`_act_dryrun.py` was used to validate the workflow before
pushing. Results:

- ✅ `ci.yml` is valid YAML (parsed by PyYAML)
- ✅ **7 jobs** (a 5-version pytest matrix plus 6 single-run jobs)
- ✅ `meta-test` correctly depends on `pytest` (Kahn's algorithm topo sort)
- ✅ `matrix.python-version` substituted correctly into `${{ ... }}` expressions
- ✅ `if: always()` preserved on the upload-artifact step
- ✅ `with:` arguments (e.g., `cache: pip`, `cache-dependency-path: pyproject.toml`) preserved

The CI workflow's `run:` blocks are identical to commands
we have already executed successfully on the host:

| CI step | Local result |
|---|---|
| `python -m pip install -e .` | tmaudit installed ✅ |
| `python -m pip install pytest scipy` | deps installed ✅ |
| `python -m pytest -m "not slow"` | **246 passed, 1 skipped in ~5s** ✅ |
| `python _check_all_regressions.py` | **14/14 bugs caught** ✅ |
| `python _check_github_templates.py` | **44/44 OK** ✅ |
| `python -m src.tmaudit audit-all ...` | audit-report.md generated ✅ |
| `python -m src.tmaudit audit-all ...` | report uploaded as artefact ✅ |
| `python _build_pyz.py` | tmaudit.pyz built ✅ |
| `python tmaudit.pyz list` | 5 papers listed ✅ |
| `python -m pyflakes src/tmaudit/ tests/` | 0 errors ✅ |

### What `_act_*` cannot simulate

- `actions/setup-python@v5` cannot actually install a different
  Python version (the host has only one Python; the matrix
  includes 3.9–3.13). The simulator prints a
  warning but does not fail.
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4` is simulated by copying files
  to `_act_run/artifacts/<name>/`.
- The Docker isolation that real `act` provides is not present;
  steps run on the host shell.

### Pre-push hook recommendation

To enforce CI validation before every push:

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push
python _check_yaml.py && python _act_dryrun.py
```

The `_check_yaml.py` script validates `ci.yml` is parseable
and has the expected structure (catches YAML syntax errors
before pushing).

### Full evidence

For the full simulation transcript (including the 5 sandbox
issues encountered and how they were worked around), see
[`act_summary.md`](./act_summary.md).
