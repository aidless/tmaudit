PART 3: SCENARIO 1 -- BUG FIX PR
==============================================================================
## What

Add a per-paper `c2_section_pattern` regression test that catches a
re-introduction of Bug 6 (Paper 5's `Statistical Protocol` section
not matched by the audit).

## Why

Bug 6 was discovered when the audit failed to recognise the
`Statistical Protocol` section in Paper 5. The fix added a
per-paper `c2_section_pattern`, but no test directly verifies this
behaviour. A future refactor of `verify_TEMPLATE.py` could
inadvertently drop the per-paper pattern and the bug would
recur silently.

Fixes #6

## Test plan

Added `tests/test_forge_happy.py::TestEndToEndAudit::test_paper_5_forks_and_passes`
and used it as the meta-test target for Bug 6. The test runs
the actual `tmaudit verify --paper 5` workflow.

## Reviewer notes

The test is intentionally NOT a pure unit test -- it actually
forks and runs `tmaudit verify --paper 5`, which means it
depends on Paper 5's `main.tex` and `refs.bib` being present
in the repo. This is a deliberate trade-off: a pure unit
test would not catch the bug if someone refactored the
substitution logic and broke the per-paper pattern handling.

PART 4: SCENARIO 2 -- NEW PAPER PR
==============================================================================
## What

Add audit support for Paper 6 (a new TMLR submission about
LLM evaluation under bounded memory).

## Why

Paper 6 is the next paper in the series. It uses the same
TTRL framework as Papers 1, 3, 4, 5, but introduces a new
empirical family (memory-bounded evaluation). The audit
config needs a new entry to handle the new family and a
new c3_concept ("bounded-memory trade-off").

## Reviewer notes

I'm uncertain about the choice of `c2_abstract_k_allowed = [3]`
for Paper 6. The abstract mentions both `n=30` and `n=100`
trials. Per CONTRIBUTING.md, `c2_abstract_k_allowed` is the
list of k values acceptable in the abstract. Paper 1's config
uses `[3]` (k=3 is the main family). I went with `[3]` for
Paper 6 to match, but if Paper 6 actually uses 5 families
(2 conditions x 3 settings), please flag this in review.

PART 5: SCENARIO 3 -- REFACTOR PR
==============================================================================
## What

Extract the `_patched` context manager from `_check_all_regressions.py`
into a new shared module `_patched.py` so it can be reused by
`_act_simulate.py` and future meta-tests.

## Why

The same "backup file, run code, restore on exit" pattern was
duplicated in `_check_all_regressions.py` and
`_act_simulate.py`. Extracting it removes ~30 lines of
duplication and makes the failure semantics easier to reason
about (one place to fix bugs in the restore logic).

The behaviour is **unchanged** -- all 46 tests still pass and
all 6 meta-tests still catch their bugs. This is a pure
refactor.

No test changes -- the refactor is verified by the existing
tests + meta-test both still passing.

## Screenshots / output

N/A (no user-visible change).

## Breaking changes

None -- the public API of `tmaudit.forge` and `tmaudit.cli` is
unchanged. The only change is internal: `_check_all_regressions.py`
now imports `_patched` from a shared module.

## Related issues / PRs

- Refs #23 (technical-debt tracker for code duplication)

## Reviewer notes

I considered putting `_patched.py` in `src/tmaudit/`
(production code) vs at the repo root (tooling). I went with
the repo root because:
  1. `_patched` is only used by meta-tests and CI tooling,
     not by `tmaudit` itself.
  2. Keeping it out of the installed package keeps
     `pip install tmaudit` lean.
  3. The hook scripts (`hooks/pre-commit`, `_check_yaml.py`,
     `_act_*.py`) all live at the repo root already.

Happy to move it to `src/tmaudit/_internal/` if you'd prefer
the production/test split to match Python packaging
conventions. The behaviour is the same either way.
