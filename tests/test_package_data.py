"""Package-data parity: what the source tree has, an install must have too.

These tests exist because the 0.7.0 candidate wheel shipped without
``detector_config/detector.yaml``. ``package-data`` listed ``templates/*`` and
``configs/*`` but not the yaml, so a non-editable install -- the path every
``pip install tmaudit`` user takes -- silently fell back to the built-in
defaults. The full test suite stayed green because it runs against ``src/``
via ``PYTHONPATH``, where the file is present. Editable installs hide it for
the same reason.

The check therefore reads the **built wheel**, not the source tree. Building
is slow, so it is marked ``slow`` and skips when ``dist/`` is absent; the
structural test below always runs and catches the ``package-data`` omission
directly.
